1. Need to add reporting for following errors.
// I have flags and text str to display. Need to ADD detection logic.

// Write Low severity errors  --- 2
  	webPageInlineStyleInCSP

// Write Log Level errors  --- 3
   webPageSSLMissingChain
   webPageSSLExpiredIssuer
   webPageSSLcertErrorNotYetValidNow
	 webPageSSLNotACACert
	 webPageSSLBad_Key
   webPageSSLBad_Signature


2. Download Icon Integration into developer tools and get rid of UI.

3. Add a logic to gather information about real world websites statistics. 
   Total count of specific errors for all website and per website error counts

4. Add more embedded links to references for each error category.  
   For e clicking on the text "userCSP" would take you to the addon.mozilla.org page 
   where you could download it.  Or clicking on HTTPOnly would take you to an article / wikipedia 
   page describing what it is. ------ DONE
   
5. How to get the report for the latest site only?

6. One sentence for each error with an arrow to expand/collapse for more details.  
   That way, the developer can see all issues quickly at once, and then drill down on each of them.
   
   <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"showHide('webPageCSP', 'webPageCSP-x'); showHide('webPageCSP1', 'webPageCSP-x');\" id=\"webPageCSP-x\" style=\"color: #d5d5d5; text-decoration:none;\">[+]</a>
   
   <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"showHide('webPageCSP', 'webPageCSP-x');\" id=\"webPageCSP-x\" style=\"color: #d5d5d5; text-decoration:none;\">[+]</a>
